# 🌟 LightCraft

**LightCraft** is a metaphysical rendering engine developed by **Schizo Studios** — designed to translate sacred geometry, light harmonics, and visual metaphysics into code-based form.  
It forms the **visual** counterpart to *SoundCraft*, uniting frequency, form, and light into a single creative system.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 **Modular Rendering Engine** — LightCraft converts metaphysical structures and LightCraft scripts into visual forms.
- 📜 **Sphinx Documentation Support** — Run `python setup.py build_docs` to compile developer or practitioner documentation.
- 🧩 **Containerized Deployment** — Designed to run as a Docker container or ServerCat Pod for ritual or automated execution.
- 💡 **UI Components** — Includes `.pytoui` views for Pyto iOS integration (Apple ecosystem–friendly).
- 🪶 **Light Geometry Framework** — Future versions will introduce LightCraft patterns, sigil templates, and harmonic field projections.
